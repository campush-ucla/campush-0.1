https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Academic,Academic,American Institute of Chemical Engineers,"The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) is a professional organization for chemical engineers. AIChE was established in 1908 with the purpose of establishing chemical engineers as a profession independent from chemists and mechanical engineers.

The mission of the AIChE student chapter at UCLA is to promote excellence in the Chemical Engineering Department of the School of Engineering and Applied Science by providing resources and support to the undergraduate students so that they can succeed academically and advance professionally.

AIChE's vision is to provide value as the global leader of the chemical engineering profession and be the lifetime center for professional and personal growth.

In 1908 a small group of chemical engineers formed a professional society to promote and improve chemical engineering as a discipline. At first, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) met with strong resistance, especially from the American Chemical Society (ACS), which claimed control over all pure and applied chemistry in the United States. In response, AIChE adopted a number of conservative measures, including strict membership criteria to keep membership low and avoid competition with ACS. Nonetheless, the value of AIChE was realized by the entire discipline in 1925, when chemical engineering became the first profession to use scholastic accreditation to ensure the consistency and quality of academic chemical engineering courses. The conservative attitude paid off when peace was made between ACS and AIChE around 1930. The membership criteria were lifted and chemical engineers joined in droves.

Today AIChE remains the principal chemical engineering professional society in the United States. Currently about 57,000 (~70%) of American chemical engineers are members.","Engineering, Academic",(949) 294-2930,uclaaiche@gmail.com,aiche.seas.ucla.edu,Corinna Lee,Mark  Keller,Brandan Taing,ORLANDO Luna

https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Academic,Academic,Psi Chi International Psychology Honor Society,"What is Psi Chi?

Psi Chi is the International Honor Society in Psychology, founded in 1929 for the purposes of encouraging, stimulating, and maintaining excellence in scholarship, and advancing the science of psychology. Membership is open to graduate and undergraduate men and women who are making the study of psychology one of their major interests, and who meet the minimum qualifications. Psi Chi is a member of the Association of College Honor Societies and is an affiliate of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the American Psychological Society (APS).

Psi Chi functions as a federation of chapters located at over 1,000 senior colleges and universities in the USA and Canada. The Central Office is located in Chattanooga, Tennessee. A Board of Directors, composed of psychologists who are Psi Chi members and who are elected by the chapters, guides the affairs of the organization and sets policy with the approval of the chapters.

What are the Goals of Psi Chi?

Psi Chi serves two major goals–one immediate and visibly rewarding to the individual member, the other slower and more difficult to accomplish, but offering greater rewards in the long run. The first of these is the Society’s obligation to provide academic recognition to its inductees by the mere fact of membership. The second goal is the obligation of each of the Society’s local chapters to nurture the spark of that accomplishment by offering a climate congenial to its creative development. For example, the chapters make active attempts to nourish and stimulate professional growth through programs designed to augment and enhance the regular curriculum and to provide practical experience and fellowship through affiliation with the chapter. In addition, the international organization provides programs to help achieve these goals, including Society and regional conventions held annually in conjunction with the psychological associations, research award competitions, and certificate recognition programs.","Honor Societies, Academic",626-607-8787,uclapsichi@gmail.com,https://uclapsichi.weebly.com/,Ouxun Jiang,Emily Berrios,Samantha Fisher,MICHAEL Gamez

https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Academic,Academic,Philosophy Club at UCLA,"The chief goal of the Philosophy Club is to provide a space for students to share and discuss ideas in an open-minded, friendly and respectful environment. This is a place where you can grapple with philosophical questions, and we can mutually work together to try to better our understanding of the world, our behavior within it, and whether or not we are justified in our beliefs. Whether you have only a budding interest in philosophy or if you are well versed in philosophical discourse, the club is a great way to expand your knowledge of the field and make friends along the way.

WEEKLY MEETING
Meetings are held every Tuesday at 6 pm in Dodd 399. During meetings, we discuss a specific philosophical issue for about an hour and a half. Topics are chosen and presented by any club members and often explore topics not commonly covered in undergraduate courses, e.g.: philosophy of progress, experience machine, and animal rights. We encourage you to present your own ideas! Sometimes we host philosophy-themed movie nights instead. 
We often go to Westwood for dinner after our weekly meetings to continue the discussion. 

MEDITATIONS PHILOSOPHY JOURNAL
Meditations is the undergraduate journal of philosophy at UCLA. The purpose of the journal is to foster philosophical thought and provide an opportunity for undergraduates to gain writing and publishing experience. Maybe you have a philosophy paper that you’re really proud of, or you’re looking for a platform to test your arguments and be challenged. Maybe you have some cool ideas but hate writing when a grade depends on it. We encourage undergraduates of any major to participate in Meditations.

BOOKCLUBS
You can also be a part of our book club. The book club offers a chance to do a close reading of philosophical texts. During our weekly discussions, we will try to understand the ideas presented in the readings by breaking down nuances such as rhetoric and symbolism.

OTHER PROGRAMS
We encourage members to attend events organized by the Philosophy Department. We also cooperate with the department to plan events for you. For example coffee time with professors, study lounge, and information panel, and more.

The NBLJ was started in 1970 by 5 African-American law students and 2 African-American law professors. The Journal was the first of its kind in the country. Because of the drop in African-American students at UCLA School of Law after the passage of proposition 209, the journal was sent to Columbia where publication could be continued.
One of the Journals founding editors noted that it was important that there be a forum for providing a theoretical framework for practical daily application of Black legal ideas and concepts. The Journal has aimed to build on this tradition by publishing articles that make a substantive contribution to current dialogue taking place around issues such as affirmative action, employment law, the criminal justice system, community development and labor issues. The Journal has a commitment to publish articles that inspire new thought, explore new alternatives and contribute to current jurisprudential stances.
In 2005, a group of students at UCLA began the process of bringing the journal back to its birthplace through the organization of a symposium entitled ""Regression Analysis: The Status of African Americans in American Legal Education."" In the Fall of 2009, a group of committed students reformed the NBLJ Board and in Spring 2010, NBLJ published at UCLA for the first time in over a decade.","Academic, African American",949-600-3523,nblj@lawnet.ucla.edu,,Tierney Sharpe Dioffo,Zalondria Graham,Jaz Buckley,KRISTOPHER Kaupalolo

Since its humble beginnings, the UCLA Stroke Program has split into two separate sister organizations: Student Stroke Team and Stroke Force. Both programs have expanded into well-ordered and effective student-operated organizations, each consisting of roughly 25 students rigorously chosen from UCLA's student body.

Today, Student Stroke Team operates 16 hours a day, seven days a week, and continues to serve their campus and local community with their dedicated team of members. SST members are research associates of Dr. Sidney Starkman for the UCLA Stroke Network and work alongside neurologists during code strokes in the Emergency Room of the UCLA Medical Center. Responsibilities include collecting information relating to the patient’s medical history and neurological deficits in order to identify potential candidates for enrollment in clinical trials that aim to find novel treatments for stroke. In this way, undergraduates are introduced to vascular neurology, emergency medicine, and clinical research.

Students in the Student Stroke Team are involved in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter research projects investigating the efficacy of various drugs and procedures applied to the patients that arrive in the UCLA Emergency Room with onset of acute ischemic stroke. As research associates, students learn the basis for the investigation of new drugs and interventions in stroke, the pre-clinical research, the phases of trials, and the proper interpretation of the results obtained. In their tasks, students utilize their knowledge of the study hypothesis and methodology, patient selection criteria, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and rationale for the use of the drug procedure. Altogether, students in this program play a significant role in the identification of candidates for stroke clinical trials while being exposed to stroke neurology, emergency medicine, unparalleled patient interaction and a tremendous knowledge of ongoing clinical trials.","Medical, Academic",(323) 208-9134,stroke@ucla.edu,https://www.strokeprogram.org/,Michael Kim,Kyle Sheu,Erica Nagase,PAMELA Cysner

UGSP is designed to provide valuable social support to these students whom may otherwise find it difficult to pursue their graduate studies. Through activities, mentorship, and community outreach, we hope to provide a community that encourages the potential and promise of those from underrepresented groups.  By promoting and improving multicultural training in psychology, we hope to not only increase ethnic minority student recruitment, retention, and graduation but also improve intergroup relations within our department. UGSP operates with the following branches:

UGSP Brown Bag Committee
This committee organizes a lecture series that is open to all graduate students. These talks are given by faculty members and post-doctoral students from underrepresented backgrounds or whose research focuses on diversity issues. Each Brown Bag lecture includes both a research presentation and a career development component. This speaker series allows graduate students to network with prominent faculty members from underrepresented groups, hopefully fostering a sense social connectedness and community within the Psychology Department.

UGSP Undergraduate Outreach Committee 
This committee organizes panels for undergraduate students to learn about various aspects of the graduate student experience. We hope to galvanize interest in graduate school by offering examples of successful underrepresented students from their own university. We also hope that this will provide undergraduates with the opportunity to connect with graduate students so they feel comfortable asking questions about diversity in graduate school.

UGSP High School Outreach Committee 
As members of underrepresented groups, we find it imperative to give back to our communities through teaching, education, and service.  UGSP will target high schools in low-income neighborhoods and will hold lectures for both parents and students about getting into college.

UGSP Social Committee

Students will be mentored by graduate students from UCLA’s Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology through all stages of an independent scientific project; from development of methods, to data collection on the UC James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve one of the 39 field sites apart of the University of California Natural Reserve System, to the write up of a scientific poster. Further, it is our goal to foster meaningful relationships between the student interns and the graduate student mentors that will last beyond just completion of their project. This will be accomplished through weekly and monthly meetings and community oriented social events. Lastly, during the duration of the program students will also be exposed to workshops and information sessions aimed at assisting in the transferring process and building tangible knowledge of scientific methods that can be applied in their future undergraduate research and graduate studies. Our program structure is as follows: (1) Community College students interested in the natural sciences and conducting scientific research in the field will be invited to apply to this program. The program will run from April to August, culminating in a 10 day trip to the field to collect data and the completion of a poster in time for the UCLA Summer Poster Symposium. (2) Students will be paired with UCLA graduate students in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department whose field research interests most closely align with their own. Students will meet virtually with their mentors weekly and in person monthly. Students and their mentors will develop an independent observational field project that could feasibly be completed with ten days of data collection during the summer. (3)By the beginning of July, students will have completed a literature review and a methods protocol for their proposed field project. In late July, students and graduate mentors will travel to the James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve. This reserve is located approximately 2 hours from UCLA in the San Bernardino National Forest and is a part of the University of California Natural Reserve System. Travel, food, and lodging will be included for all participants. (4) While in the field participants will be assisted by their graduate student mentors in collecting and analyzing data for their proposed project. Before returning home each student will have a completed scientific poster. (5) Aside from enacting their proposed research, students will attend skill-building workshops focused on cultivating tangible scientific and fieldwork skills that can be used throughout their careers. For example, interns will be introduced to ‘R’ Statistical software for data analysis and taught how to use species identification guides in the field.

The organisation's purpose comes in two parts. 

One, students from all disciplines and fields are encouraged to come for bi-weekly meetings to discuss and explore readings, movies, political and social frameworks, and other materials which support historically and presently marginalised communities, movements, and histories. Through these group discussions, students can find, connect, and support each other not just through an interdisciplinary lens, but one which attempts to center their voices and perspectives outside of a classic western canon. As we learn about these things, students can talk about their experiences as students and as artists who hope to make change. 

Second, students will work collaboratively to organise and put on bi-annual events. As students learn and expand upon different ideas and theories, we hope to expand the discussion beyond the group through a panel symposium centered around related themes. The panel would consist of both students and invited guest lecturers of varying fields and practices to present and engage with attendees. The purpose of this symposium would be to allow students a public platform to engage with their own interests and work collaboratively with their contemporaries (working artists, poets, writers, e.t.c).

Heritage students may include individuals who study or research a community with which they share cultural and/or ethnic roots, including but not limited to: indigenous peoples, native peoples, people of color, and biracial or multiracial individuals. 

Our focus is connecting interdisciplinary projects and people to foster collaboration and healthy academic networking. Heritage students face challenges not only on campus, where they tend to be underrepresented, but also in the field. Balancing the roles of researcher and heritage students can be a difficult endeavor, and by creating a support system, we hope to combat these challenges and make heritage research purposeful, ethical, and empowering. Heritage students play a special role in research by connecting their cultural community with the academic community. The group is intended to be both social (where students with similar interests, general backgrounds, and research can interact) and professional (where students can discuss academic endeavors, pursuits, and goals). 

In a time where student diversity is often co-opted by institutions seeking to diversity their departmental statistics, we seek to refocus heritage students back onto their goals, their communities, and the motivations that keep them working on these unique and personal projects.

Our first large goal is to create one workshop per year open to the campus to connect scholars across different departments and programs at UCLA. A potential topic of the workshop will focus on community engagement: how does research across departments actively involve local communities in research, on both the macro and micro scales? What is our role as a researcher in underrepresented communities? How does research translate from the local community to the academic community? The purpose of this workshop is to share methodologies and engage in decolonial discourses.

Currently, there seem to be no organisations on campus that run similar events/activities. There are several societies involved in fundraising for cancer (CAC at UCLA, BFPC) , however there are no organisations that serve as platform for academic engagement for those interested/involved in cancer research and oncology.  
To confirm that there are no clashes with other such societies, I also contacted committee members of BFPC, CAC at UCLA etc. and informed them about our society and there seemed to be no clashes with any of them and were willing to collaborate with/help support our society.
Oncology and Cancer Research are really rapidly growing fields and are currently quite under-represented by our student community and need to gain more momentum. SOCR’s specific focus on these areas will allow more in depth discussion and debate surrounding the ethical controversies and scientific advancements that underlie the ground breaking research in these areas. The socials hosted by the society and the societies’ stimulating academic environment will bring together students who share similar scientific and medical interests and will help raise awareness within the student body and broader community about a new and exciting area of scientific research. 
Our members will include students from a variety of backgrounds and educational interests. SOCR believes that each of its members has unique skills and can contribute to the successful advancement of the SOCR mission. We have a chance at the inception of this research to incorporate our highest ideals of service and unity. As students and future leaders we strive for a world that is better tomorrow than it is today. Oncology  and cancer research will help us achieve this brighter and healthier tomorrow.

POOL is driven by an interest in an expanding definition of architectural work that, in a culture of high volume content exchange, considers curation as a primary form of cultural production. Following this, we contend that the syllabus, the archive, and the aggregator are all valid forms of architectural work that we welcome and encourage in our publication.

POOL is a site of this type of work, experimenting with interface between its three primary platforms: event, digital, and print. Events and ongoing digital publication act not only as productive indicators of relevant themes, but also feed into an annual print edition.

POOL aspires to reach new audiences, seeing the separation of fields into hermeneutic discourses as unproductive, and strives instead for the inclusion of new and unexpected audiences through the incorporation of media unconventional to architectural discourse.","Journals, Arts",(310) 562-4535,pool@aud.ucla.edu,pool-la.com,Rayne Laborde,Phoebe Webster,Hannah Hortick,ORLANDO Luna

The organisation's purpose comes in two parts. 

One, students from all disciplines and fields are encouraged to come for bi-weekly meetings to discuss and explore readings, movies, political and social frameworks, and other materials which support historically and presently marginalised communities, movements, and histories. Through these group discussions, students can find, connect, and support each other not just through an interdisciplinary lens, but one which attempts to center their voices and perspectives outside of a classic western canon. As we learn about these things, students can talk about their experiences as students and as artists who hope to make change. 

Second, students will work collaboratively to organise and put on bi-annual events. As students learn and expand upon different ideas and theories, we hope to expand the discussion beyond the group through a panel symposium centered around related themes. The panel would consist of both students and invited guest lecturers of varying fields and practices to present and engage with attendees. The purpose of this symposium would be to allow students a public platform to engage with their own interests and work collaboratively with their contemporaries (working artists, poets, writers, e.t.c).

V-Day is a spirit: we believe womxn should spend their lives creating and thriving rather than surviving or recovering from terrible atrocities. It is a catalyst: by raising money and consciousness, it will unify and strengthen existing anti-violence efforts. Triggering far-reaching awareness, it will lay the groundwork for new educational, protective, and legislative endeavors throughout the world. V-Day is a process: we will work as long as it takes. We will not stop until the violence stops. The V-Day Coalition brought ""The Vagina Monologues"" to UCLA for four years, but has turned to producing and creating ""Lips.""
LIPS is a student written, produced and performed play. This play is a response to Vagina Monologues; V-Day has historically performed V-Day with a disclaimer that Vagina Monologues leaves out important narratives, but its mission as a whole is good. After deciding that a disclaimer is no longer enough, we decided to address the issues presented by Vagina Monologues.

Thesis:

To establish a student design coalition with a creative and similar-minded community that takes part in the creation of projects and research, promoting innovation in the realm of design through inclusivity.

To be a space where any student can bring an idea that they have had at the back of the mind or buried in their notebook, and collaborate with or get feedback from other like-minded members.

While there are other clubs relating to design, there is no cohesive campus-wide design community.

Elevator Pitch:

There is no cohesive campus-wide design-centric community where a student can bring any idea to collaborate with other passionate members to realize their aspirations.
We are creating an organization to disrupt the inert and fragmented design environment at UCLA.

The student organization incorporated as a nonprofit in 2010 and began expansion to universities across the globe. While early programs focused on strictly technology- and web-enabled startups, demand has led the team to expand the program to function across broader entrepreneurial endeavors. Schools have hosted 3DS programs focused on themes such as social innovation, energy, culinary, hardware, and more.
Foregoing a grant-supported model, the founders developed an earned-revenues strategy—3DS charges universities, governments, and corporations to deliver programs—which allowed the organization to grow in a scalable and sustainable way while preserving mission autonomy. Running 3DS as a successful business operation keeps entrepreneurship in the organizational DNA and allows the organization to remain faithful to the philosophy of learning-by-doing.","Business, Leadership",(424)386-6465,3daystartupucla@gmail.com,http://ucla.3daystartup.org,Saite Yuan,Lecheng Shi,Crystal Li,JAKE Gildea

MEChA was founded on the principles of self-determination for the liberation of our people. We believe that political involvement and education is the avenue for change in our society. 
The organization grew during the Civil Rights and Chicano Movement in the 1960s, and the group coalesced out of several organizations formed during that turbulent decade and came together at a conference in Denver. One of the founding documents that was created in the conference was ""El Plan Espiritual de Aztlán,"" which reflects the sentiment of the Latino/Chicano youth during an era of a turbulent social climate. In 1968, the United Mexican American Students (UMAS), Sal Castro, and other youth organized the East L.A. walkouts, called the Blowouts, a series of protests against unfair conditions in Los Angeles schools. Following the blowouts in March of 1969, students, teachers and community activists gathered at the University of California, Santa Barbara and drafted “El Plan de Santa Barbara,” which has now become important history and documented what has guided our organization to better serve our community. 
Through these documents, our organization is dedicated to the empowerment of raza students by working towards self-determination in our communities. Students develop a sense of identity, leadership and community. As an organization, we recognize our role as the official voice of all raza students on campus, and, taking this into account, our purpose is to advocate on behalf of raza students needs as well as offer our support. MEChA’s goal is to create a unity amongst students on campus and to make sure they are aware that they have a familia away from home without forgetting how community conditions have historically affected us. We aim to increase retention through our Calmecac mentoring program, increase educational access through Xinachtli, and raise consciousness of community issues with our Raza Youth Empowerment Program.","Political, Cultural",(323) 427-7926,mechadeucla@gmail.com,mechadeucla.com,Vivyana Prado,Eduardo Velasquez,Brian Luna,ORLANDO Luna

On the whole, we hope that this organization will promote the creation of lasting relationships between students and their peers and students and their teaching teams, in and outside of the cluster.

https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Cultural,Cultural,Heritage Students of UCLA,"Heritage Students of UCLA is a professional and social space where self-identifying heritage students can connect, share research, and engage in community efforts. Heritage students may include individuals who study or research a community with which they share cultural and/or ethnic roots, including but not limited to: indigenous peoples, native peoples, people of color, and biracial or multiracial individuals. 

Our focus is connecting interdisciplinary projects and people to foster collaboration and healthy academic networking. Heritage students face challenges not only on campus, where they tend to be underrepresented, but also in the field. Balancing the roles of researcher and heritage students can be a difficult endeavor, and by creating a support system, we hope to combat these challenges and make heritage research purposeful, ethical, and empowering. Heritage students play a special role in research by connecting their cultural community with the academic community. The group is intended to be both social (where students with similar interests, general backgrounds, and research can interact) and professional (where students can discuss academic endeavors, pursuits, and goals). 

In a time where student diversity is often co-opted by institutions seeking to diversity their departmental statistics, we seek to refocus heritage students back onto their goals, their communities, and the motivations that keep them working on these unique and personal projects.

Our first large goal is to create one workshop per year open to the campus to connect scholars across different departments and programs at UCLA. A potential topic of the workshop will focus on community engagement: how does research across departments actively involve local communities in research, on both the macro and micro scales? What is our role as a researcher in underrepresented communities? How does research translate from the local community to the academic community? The purpose of this workshop is to share methodologies and engage in decolonial discourses.

Since 2002, PAC has planned and executed an annual 26-Hour Dance Marathon. DM seeks to empower the UCLA campus community in the fight against pediatric AIDS, raising funds and awareness about the importance of HIV education and testing, while helping young people make a difference in halting the spread of this devastating pandemic. 

Now entering its 18th year, DM has grown to be the largest student-run philanthropic event that raises funds and awareness for HIV/AIDS. However, DM is only a part of our larger, umbrella organization: the Pediatric AIDS Coalition (PAC). Now, not only will the students involved with PAC put on and participate in DM, but they will also participate in other events in an attempt to involve more of the community; people that may be inclined to fight for the cause but may not necessarily be interested in a DM.

Dance Marathon has raised over $5.5 million in the past 16 years, benefiting HIV-positive children around the world. Proceeds benefit the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, “the largest Pediatric AIDS foundation in the United States“, the Laurel Foundation which is a free summer camp program that provide HIV-affected children with the experience of a lifetime, and the UCLA AIDS Institute, a cutting-edge research facility at the forefront of the search for a cure. Dance Marathon 2019 will be in the historic PAULEY PAVILION in April 2019!

PAC also sponsors activities on campus throughout the year for the UCLA community including AIDS education in the form of performances and presentations, mentor days with kids from the camps, free HIV testing, and coordination of major events for World AIDS Day at UCLA. New programs include the Life Skills Retreat and a Family Mentorship Program. PAC is constantly looking for new, innovative ways to unite students, community activists, celebrities and leaders around the cause of pediatric AIDS treatment and eradication, and PAC is looking forward to its expansion into the greater Los Angeles community.

DM has become a poster in the UCLA community, so much so that people commonly say that you can't graduate UCLA without having done DM at least once. People say that our generation is not empathetic, but DM proves them wrong. We unite 140 people as a committee and 3000+ in the community to join together to fight this cause.","Social Activism, Educational",(702) 403-0472,pac.president.ucla@gmail.com,https://pediatricaidscoalition.org/,Nina Enholm,Eleni Rally,Sophie  Ahmad,PAMELA Cysner

The LEAD program will target primarily African American 9th and 10th grade students who did not pass algebra in middle school or their previous year in high school. The students will take a diagnostic at the beginning and end of the year to monitor growth in specific concepts for each student and the group as a whole. Based upon these tests the curriculum for the program will be organized around the concepts of greatest struggle as highlighted by the diagnostic. 
The first approach that LEAD will take will attempt to counter the present learning style in a typical math classroom, as it will encourage asking questions, working in groups, and a growth mindset. The program will attempt to execute the following three elements: basic skills, conceptual understanding and problem solving. LEAD will use real life application relevant to the students and by motivating students to work together and to think out loud, we hope to build leadership skills and development.
The second approach includes having activities and discussions that allow students to examine the intersections of race, class and math to get a greater understanding of the disparity of African American students in high level math classes and to combat the stigma of inadequacy.","Educational, Community Service",(424) 313-4860,lead@ucla.edu,https://leaducla.weebly.com/,Kailash Ram,Smriti Sanchita,Eshan Uniyal,ASHLEY Pham

Club members will also help participants understand when something is a medical emergency and when they should seek help. Each site we visit will also be provided with a list of contacts for medical and psychological help within their immediate area.

Besides the hands on style skills training, we will also offer free Red Cross Adult and Pediatric First Aid/CPR/AED certification to any participants seeking official certification.

In addition to community outreach, this club also aims to collect data from the underserved community and participate in a longitudinal research study. Club members will create surveys and collect data before and after visiting sites. The study will focus on participants experience with medical emergencies, their level of preparedness, and their willingness to help.

Lastly, we want to work on creating first aid kits tailored to the homeless and underserved communities. These will be handed out to all participants who complete our program.

Through Building Heroes, club members will gain a deeper understanding of first aid techniques, and learn how to lead hands on discussions and lectures. In addition, they will gain important field research experience. Perhaps most rewarding, club members will be given the chance to make a difference in the underserved community by sharing life saving knowledge.","Educational, Health and Wellness",(818) 270-1428,Buildingtodaysheroes@gmail.com,,Ruthvik Gundala,Donna Wong,Kristen Stefanescu,PAMELA Cysner

Currently, there seem to be no organisations on campus that run similar events/activities. There are several societies involved in fundraising for cancer (CAC at UCLA, BFPC) , however there are no organisations that serve as platform for academic engagement for those interested/involved in cancer research and oncology.  
To confirm that there are no clashes with other such societies, I also contacted committee members of BFPC, CAC at UCLA etc. and informed them about our society and there seemed to be no clashes with any of them and were willing to collaborate with/help support our society.
Oncology and Cancer Research are really rapidly growing fields and are currently quite under-represented by our student community and need to gain more momentum. SOCR’s specific focus on these areas will allow more in depth discussion and debate surrounding the ethical controversies and scientific advancements that underlie the ground breaking research in these areas. The socials hosted by the society and the societies’ stimulating academic environment will bring together students who share similar scientific and medical interests and will help raise awareness within the student body and broader community about a new and exciting area of scientific research. 
Our members will include students from a variety of backgrounds and educational interests. SOCR believes that each of its members has unique skills and can contribute to the successful advancement of the SOCR mission. We have a chance at the inception of this research to incorporate our highest ideals of service and unity.

The mission of the AIChE student chapter at UCLA is to promote excellence in the Chemical Engineering Department of the School of Engineering and Applied Science by providing resources and support to the undergraduate students so that they can succeed academically and advance professionally.

AIChE's vision is to provide value as the global leader of the chemical engineering profession and be the lifetime center for professional and personal growth.

In 1908 a small group of chemical engineers formed a professional society to promote and improve chemical engineering as a discipline. At first, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) met with strong resistance, especially from the American Chemical Society (ACS), which claimed control over all pure and applied chemistry in the United States. In response, AIChE adopted a number of conservative measures, including strict membership criteria to keep membership low and avoid competition with ACS. Nonetheless, the value of AIChE was realized by the entire discipline in 1925, when chemical engineering became the first profession to use scholastic accreditation to ensure the consistency and quality of academic chemical engineering courses. The conservative attitude paid off when peace was made between ACS and AIChE around 1930. The membership criteria were lifted and chemical engineers joined in droves.

Today AIChE remains the principal chemical engineering professional society in the United States. Currently about 57,000 (~70%) of American chemical engineers are members.","Engineering, Academic",(949) 294-2930,uclaaiche@gmail.com,aiche.seas.ucla.edu,Corinna Lee,Mark  Keller,Brandan Taing,ORLANDO Luna

Specifically, our team of UCLA students designs, manufactures, and tests custom drones for accomplishing a series of mission objectives, as outlined by the AUVSI SUAS competition rules for the current season. This competition is held annually at the end of the school year in Maryland, where over 60 teams (half of which are international) compete for the best mission performance, technical design paper, and flight readiness presentation.
UAS@UCLA complements the undergraduate engineering education at UCLA by offering the chance to gain hands-on experience on a complex engineering project. This project requires members to not only think outside the box of their major, but also learn collaboration and management skills through experience. Ultimately, UAS@UCLA is a big commitment, but the skills that are taught on the team directly apply to the professional environments you will experience in later jobs and internships.
As of 2018, UAS@UCLA has competed twice in the AUVSI competition, producing the two drones seen in the videos above. Our most recent drone, Spinny, is a 5ft diameter industrial-grade drone capable of 100lbs maximum lift and close to an hour of flight time at its base configuration. The current plan for this upcoming season is to use the existing flight vehicle hardware to mature the software framework running on board and on the ground to maximize mission performance and reliability of the platform. In addition, our team will begin the design process for our next drone -- a plane designed to build upon the legacy of Spinny and provide a new set of challenges for our team to address. Although the plane may turn into a two-year development, there will be lots of engineering questions to be answered by new members to ensure the success of this platform.
Finally, UAS@UCLA is a family, and the connections you make on the team can not only serve to further your professional career, but also give you support during and beyond your time in the undergraduate programs offered at UCLA. One of the main goals of our 2018 - 2019 leadership team is to grow our club's culture and attract not only the best engineers to join our program, but also develop a diversified team with extensive collaboration opportunities among other teams at UCLA and internal career resources for leading members into their dream internship/job position in the STEM fields.","Engineering, Technology",(760)681-6528,unmannedsystems.ucla@gmail.com,uasatucla.org,David Thorne,Comran Morshed,Armaan Singh,ORLANDO Luna

First printed in 1968, NOMMO joined Student Media in 1969 to become the first ethnic student run publication on a college campus in the United States.

In today’s often confusing and certainly tumultuous societal environment the most obvious fundamental ingredient toward reason, understanding, and progress is improved communication of thoughts and realities. In that sense, NOMMO is multipurpose and multifunctional. It fills a deep gap: it helps Black students identify and clarify a vast array of attitudes and goals, and it is an invaluable step toward wider communication between Black students and the campus community and the community-at-large. The world that the news media offers to their Black audiences is almost totally white in both appearance and attitude, save for the moments where Black death enters as a spectacle. In response, NOMMO seeks to give currency to the expression of Black power for Black people through the power of the written word.

In 1963 James Baldwin aptly noted, “The future of the Negro in this country is precisely as bright or as dark as the future of the country.” NOMMO prioritizes the Black community in order to shine light on the issues that reverberate throughout society. It is a beacon that seeks to find and report the truth.","Media, Ethnic",(310)825-9898,nommo@media.ucla.edu,https://nommomagazine.com/,Asia Dessert,Mahala Herron-Rutland,Bianca Onyekwere,MELISSA Veluz-Abraham

To promote the safeguarding of such a precious resource, AMIA Student Chapter members engage in a multitude of activities including attending symposia, organizing lectures and curating screenings of significant films.

By attending an AMIA Student Chapter of UCLA screening or event, you are personally contributing to the ongoing education of rising archivists and preservationists. With help from you, students are able to engage in more activities at a greater level.","Film, Career Planning",(323) 463-1500,ucla.amia@gmail.com,https://uclaamia.wordpress.com/,Zachary Rutland,Dan Molloy,Cameron Jappe,JAKE Gildea

We are the only fraternity in the United States that unites its members under the principles of leadership, character, and service alongside the grand principles of Arab culture.

The purpose of Beta Delta Alpha is to unite its members in a brotherhood based upon the bonds of sincere and lasting friendship, to stimulate one another in the pursuit of knowledge and success, to promote the moral and social culture of its members, and to develop plans for guidance and unity in action. Most of all, this fraternity seeks to promote respect and loyalty to one’s heritage and never forget the culture of our ancestors.

We wish to show the diversity in culture that exists within the Arab World and the ways in which Arab men have impacted Arab culture, society, and history and continue to be active representatives of Arab culture around the world.

The sorority supports and provides a safe space for people of all sexual orientations, gender identities, and diverse backgrounds. It emphasizes emotional support, personal development,
unconditional acceptance.

Founded in Spring of 2009, Gamma Rho Lambda has expanded into the first LGBT sorority on campus. In Spring 2010 GRL officially affiliated with UCLA's Multi-Interest Greek Council and became Zeta Chapter.

Some examples of Gamma Rho Lambda's events are: game night, home-cooked dinners, Women's Day, socials, sister dates, as well as an end of the year banquet. We've volunteered at AIDS Walk and Vote for Equality and marched at LA pride and Long Beach Pride. We've fundraised by selling bracelets, rainbow cupcakes, and other baked goods.

Gamma Rho Lambda is much smaller than most typical sororities, but we pride ourselves in this fact. Our intimate size allows us to get to know every member and grow together as a community. Our biggest priority is to create a second home for our members, so that every member feels they have a family at UCLA. We provide an opportunity for growth and diversity. In addition, Gamma Rho Lambda aims to provide a safe, accepting, and supportive space for queer members who may not be out to their families.

On a national level, Gamma Rho Lambda currently has 14 chapters across the country and 1 colony. Our chapters are at Arizona State University, San Diego State University, CSU Northridge, UCLA, Purdue, SUNY- Albany, Northern Arizona University, University of Houston, UC Berkley, and UC Riverside, Ball State,Tulane, Iowa State, and American University. We also have a colony at University of Iowa. Each year we have a summer convention where representatives from all the chapters and colonies come and meet their fellow siblings. This weekend is not only a bonding experience, but an experience to share what every chapter has accomplished while spreading both ideas and concerns to each other and our National Council.

We were founded on four principles that our members still demonstrate today: Scholarship, Service, Sisterhood, and Finer Womanhood. On January 23, 1982, seven collegiate women at the University of California, Los Angeles chartered the Nu Lambda Chapter of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. Ever since, the ladies of Zeta have exemplified the principles of Zeta through campus programs, community service, and in their own personal endeavors.

Psi Chi is the International Honor Society in Psychology, founded in 1929 for the purposes of encouraging, stimulating, and maintaining excellence in scholarship, and advancing the science of psychology. Membership is open to graduate and undergraduate men and women who are making the study of psychology one of their major interests, and who meet the minimum qualifications. Psi Chi is a member of the Association of College Honor Societies and is an affiliate of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the American Psychological Society (APS).

Psi Chi functions as a federation of chapters located at over 1,000 senior colleges and universities in the USA and Canada. The Central Office is located in Chattanooga, Tennessee. A Board of Directors, composed of psychologists who are Psi Chi members and who are elected by the chapters, guides the affairs of the organization and sets policy with the approval of the chapters.

What are the Goals of Psi Chi?

Psi Chi serves two major goals–one immediate and visibly rewarding to the individual member, the other slower and more difficult to accomplish, but offering greater rewards in the long run. The first of these is the Society’s obligation to provide academic recognition to its inductees by the mere fact of membership. The second goal is the obligation of each of the Society’s local chapters to nurture the spark of that accomplishment by offering a climate congenial to its creative development. For example, the chapters make active attempts to nourish and stimulate professional growth through programs designed to augment and enhance the regular curriculum and to provide practical experience and fellowship through affiliation with the chapter. In addition, the international organization provides programs to help achieve these goals, including Society and regional conventions held annually in conjunction with the psychological associations, research award competitions, and certificate recognition programs.","Honor Societies, Academic",626-607-8787,uclapsichi@gmail.com,https://uclapsichi.weebly.com/,Ouxun Jiang,Emily Berrios,Samantha Fisher,MICHAEL Gamez

Whether you have only a budding interest in philosophy or if you are well versed in philosophical discourse, the club is a great way to expand your knowledge of the field and make friends along the way.

WEEKLY MEETING
Meetings are held every Tuesday at 6 pm in Dodd 399. During meetings, we discuss a specific philosophical issue for about an hour and a half. Topics are chosen and presented by any club members and often explore topics not commonly covered in undergraduate courses, e.g.: philosophy of progress, experience machine, and animal rights. We encourage you to present your own ideas! Sometimes we host philosophy-themed movie nights instead. 
We often go to Westwood for dinner after our weekly meetings to continue the discussion. 

MEDITATIONS PHILOSOPHY JOURNAL
Meditations is the undergraduate journal of philosophy at UCLA. The purpose of the journal is to foster philosophical thought and provide an opportunity for undergraduates to gain writing and publishing experience. Maybe you have a philosophy paper that you’re really proud of, or you’re looking for a platform to test your arguments and be challenged. Maybe you have some cool ideas but hate writing when a grade depends on it. We encourage undergraduates of any major to participate in Meditations.

BOOKCLUBS
You can also be a part of our book club. The book club offers a chance to do a close reading of philosophical texts. During our weekly discussions, we will try to understand the ideas presented in the readings by breaking down nuances such as rhetoric and symbolism.

OTHER PROGRAMS
We encourage members to attend events organized by the Philosophy Department. We also cooperate with the department to plan events for you. For example coffee time with professors, study lounge, and information panel, and more.

POOL is the student journal of the Department of Architecture & Urban Design at the University of California, Los Angeles.

POOL is driven by an interest in an expanding definition of architectural work that, in a culture of high volume content exchange, considers curation as a primary form of cultural production. Following this, we contend that the syllabus, the archive, and the aggregator are all valid forms of architectural work that we welcome and encourage in our publication.

POOL is a site of this type of work, experimenting with interface between its three primary platforms: event, digital, and print. Events and ongoing digital publication act not only as productive indicators of relevant themes, but also feed into an annual print edition.

POOL aspires to reach new audiences, seeing the separation of fields into hermeneutic discourses as unproductive, and strives instead for the inclusion of new and unexpected audiences through the incorporation of media unconventional to architectural discourse.","Journals, Arts",(310) 562-4535,pool@aud.ucla.edu,pool-la.com,Rayne Laborde,Phoebe Webster,Hannah Hortick,ORLANDO Luna

?
Notably, the development and involvement in AI ethics by students and professionals has been relatively nascent.  The foresight of how important it is to regulate AI through the lens of ethical discussion and implementation is of paramount significance within the setting of the rapid development of AI and how it has already permeated of our daily lives.
?
As such, the AI Robotics Ethics Society was founded in 2018 at UCLA by Aaron Hui to promote the awareness and importance of ethical implementation/regulation of AI. AIRES achieves its mission of ensuring AI is created both ethically and responsibly through a three-pronged approach:
?
1. To host a series of intra- and inter-departmental discussions at universities on AI and Robotics ethics.
?
2. To create a network and promote such awareness through hosting discussions and conferences with chapters of the AI Robotics Ethics Society.  
?
3. To create a small lecture series on the latest breakthroughs and achievements in AI and Robotic ethics.

Our Vision 

Evangelize: God desires for all men to be saved. To make a disciple, one must find a willing person first, a process that often entails sharing the gospel to those who haven’t accepted it before. By sharing the good news of the Gospel to people everywhere, we open opportunities for them to know Jesus and receive his salvation. This vision of evangelism operates on all scales, from our families and friends to the nations.
Establish: God wants every believer to mature in their faith in Him. We hope to establish disciples of Christ by laying a foundation of devotion to Christ and building Christlike character. Devotion to Christ as expressed by an enjoyment of the Word of God, a zeal for prayer, and a love for the family of Christ are essentials to establish in a disciple’s life. These are necessary for transforming a disciple’s character to be more Christlike.
Equip: God commands us all to go and make disciples! We equip brothers and sisters to make new disciples themselves by teaching them how to share the Gospel and how to establish and encourage others in the faith. By training committed disciples and challenging their faith, we hope to develop them into disciplemakers, and perhaps even makers of disciplemakers.","Religious - Christian, Leadership",408-219-4950,icabruins@gmail.com,http://www.tinyurl.com/bruinica,Adele Zhang,Jordan Ong,Claire Su,ASHLEY Pham

The student organization incorporated as a nonprofit in 2010 and began expansion to universities across the globe. While early programs focused on strictly technology- and web-enabled startups, demand has led the team to expand the program to function across broader entrepreneurial endeavors. Schools have hosted 3DS programs focused on themes such as social innovation, energy, culinary, hardware, and more.
Foregoing a grant-supported model, the founders developed an earned-revenues strategy—3DS charges universities, governments, and corporations to deliver programs—which allowed the organization to grow in a scalable and sustainable way while preserving mission autonomy. Running 3DS as a successful business operation keeps entrepreneurship in the organizational DNA and allows the organization to remain faithful to the philosophy of learning-by-doing.","Business, Leadership",(424)386-6465,3daystartupucla@gmail.com,http://ucla.3daystartup.org,Saite Yuan,Lecheng Shi,Crystal Li,JAKE Gildea

It draws its name from the Ki-Swahili term Nommo, which means the magical power of the word. First printed in 1968, NOMMO joined Student Media in 1969 to become the first ethnic student run publication on a college campus in the United States.

In today’s often confusing and certainly tumultuous societal environment the most obvious fundamental ingredient toward reason, understanding, and progress is improved communication of thoughts and realities. In that sense, NOMMO is multipurpose and multifunctional. It fills a deep gap: it helps Black students identify and clarify a vast array of attitudes and goals, and it is an invaluable step toward wider communication between Black students and the campus community and the community-at-large. The world that the news media offers to their Black audiences is almost totally white in both appearance and attitude, save for the moments where Black death enters as a spectacle. In response, NOMMO seeks to give currency to the expression of Black power for Black people through the power of the written word.

In 1963 James Baldwin aptly noted, “The future of the Negro in this country is precisely as bright or as dark as the future of the country.” NOMMO prioritizes the Black community in order to shine light on the issues that reverberate throughout society. It is a beacon that seeks to find and report the truth.","Media, Ethnic",(310)825-9898,nommo@media.ucla.edu,https://nommomagazine.com/,Asia Dessert,Mahala Herron-Rutland,Bianca Onyekwere,MELISSA Veluz-Abraham

Without homes or any mode of transportation, hundreds of homeless people walk an average of 13 miles a day. Some walk for days, weeks, or months without having access to basic necessities such as clean water or properly fitted shoes. Many even refuse to air out their feet, conducive of many foot problems, afraid that their shoes might get stolen. As we, Happy Feet Clinic, provide those basic necessities and more, we are blessed with a powerfully humbling experience.

At shelters around Los Angeles, including the Union Rescue Mission in downtown L.A., the Ocean Park Community Center in Santa Monica, the New Image Emergency Shelter in South LA, and PATH in Westwood, we treat hundreds of homeless people to a soothing foot wash in a tub of warm, soapy water. Next, we work side by side with podiatrists as they administer foot exams for the homeless community. Throughout the process, we interact with a variety of people in need of help and most importantly become aware of the large prominence of under-served communities and their critical need for assistance.

For many students, it is hard to grasp how prominent this population is in a thriving country as America. At first, students squirm at the thought of washing feet (especially those that may need much more care than our own). As soon as the event comes to an end however, many are instilled with the feeling to return again and again.

Since its humble beginnings, the UCLA Stroke Program has split into two separate sister organizations: Student Stroke Team and Stroke Force. Both programs have expanded into well-ordered and effective student-operated organizations, each consisting of roughly 25 students rigorously chosen from UCLA's student body.

Today, Student Stroke Team operates 16 hours a day, seven days a week, and continues to serve their campus and local community with their dedicated team of members. SST members are research associates of Dr. Sidney Starkman for the UCLA Stroke Network and work alongside neurologists during code strokes in the Emergency Room of the UCLA Medical Center. Responsibilities include collecting information relating to the patient’s medical history and neurological deficits in order to identify potential candidates for enrollment in clinical trials that aim to find novel treatments for stroke. In this way, undergraduates are introduced to vascular neurology, emergency medicine, and clinical research.

Students in the Student Stroke Team are involved in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter research projects investigating the efficacy of various drugs and procedures applied to the patients that arrive in the UCLA Emergency Room with onset of acute ischemic stroke. As research associates, students learn the basis for the investigation of new drugs and interventions in stroke, the pre-clinical research, the phases of trials, and the proper interpretation of the results obtained. In their tasks, students utilize their knowledge of the study hypothesis and methodology, patient selection criteria, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and rationale for the use of the drug procedure. Altogether, students in this program play a significant role in the identification of candidates for stroke clinical trials while being exposed to stroke neurology, emergency medicine, unparalleled patient interaction and a tremendous knowledge of ongoing clinical trials.","Medical, Academic",(323) 208-9134,stroke@ucla.edu,https://www.strokeprogram.org/,Michael Kim,Kyle Sheu,Erica Nagase,PAMELA Cysner

In the Stroke Force program, undergraduates are involved in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter research projects investigating the efficacy of various drugs and procedures applied to the patients that arrive in the UCLA Emergency Room with onset of acute ischemic stroke. Students serve as research associates and work alongside neurologists during code strokes. Responsibilities include collecting information relating to the patient’s medical history and neurological deficits in order to identify potential candidates for enrollment in clinical trials that aim to find novel treatments for stroke. Students also serve as speakers who reach out to various communities. To date, more than 120 students have participated in the program, delivering over 300 lectures to over 7000 individuals. Formal testing has demonstrated that these presentations are highly effective, resulting in a significant increase in post-education stroke awareness. Through integrating experiences from clinical exposure in the Ronald Reagan Emergency Department, neurological rounds, health fairs, and presentations, this sect of the Stroke Program strives to provide a force to minimize response time and to facilitate treatment.","Medical, Service - Outreach",(951) 567-3479,strokeforce@gmail.com,https://www.strokeprogram.org/,Nathan Sanchez,Ikaasa Suri,Jakob Morgenland,PAMELA Cysner

This disease has devastating impacts on patients and their families, and thus, efforts should be taken to decrease its incidence among the population. A significant number of cancer cases can be prevented with a healthy lifestyle, as environmental factors play an influential role in mutating genes and activating cancerous cells. Considering the current concerns regarding this disease, our organization aims to increase awareness about different cancers and their prevention methods. By doing so, we hope to ultimately decrease the number of new cancer cases each year.
1- Since drug and alcohol abuse, and obesity are linked to cancer, CPP conducts information sessions, activities and events to promote a healthy lifestyle—both at UCLA and at local highschools.
2- As a prevention method for skin cancer, sun-safety sessions shall be conducted to emphasize the importance of sunscreen.
3- General meetings shall host panels with physicians to increase cancer awareness.
4- Cancer-related careers shall be discussed in general meetings, in multiple fields.
5- General meetings can host cancer researchers to inform club members about the recent advances in cancer treatment and prevention
6- Fundraiser events shall be organized to raise money for cancer research and treatment, collaborating with well-known charities.
7- Most importantly, CPP aims to increase awareness about Human 
Papillomavirus (HPV) not only in the UCLA community but also in the greater Los Angeles area. 
The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is currently a great concern of the medical society as it can develop into various health problems such as genital warts and different cancers. In fact, HPV is the leading cause of cervical cancer among the general population. Fortunately, there are methods to prevent HPV such as becoming vaccinated, being screened, and practicing safer sexual relationships. Despite being a vulnerable target for HPV—the most common sexually transmitted infection—a significant number of college students are unaware of this disease and its prevention methods. We hope that by explaining the complications associated with HPV we can increase the rate of vaccination in our community and thus, decrease the prevalence of cervical cancer.","Service - Community Involvement, Medical",310-488-8260,uclacpp@gmail.com,,Golbarg  Rahimi,Rana Yakhshi Tafti,Mahdi Rafati,ASHLEY Pham

MEChA was founded on the principles of self-determination for the liberation of our people. We believe that political involvement and education is the avenue for change in our society. 
The organization grew during the Civil Rights and Chicano Movement in the 1960s, and the group coalesced out of several organizations formed during that turbulent decade and came together at a conference in Denver. One of the founding documents that was created in the conference was ""El Plan Espiritual de Aztlán,"" which reflects the sentiment of the Latino/Chicano youth during an era of a turbulent social climate. In 1968, the United Mexican American Students (UMAS), Sal Castro, and other youth organized the East L.A. walkouts, called the Blowouts, a series of protests against unfair conditions in Los Angeles schools. Following the blowouts in March of 1969, students, teachers and community activists gathered at the University of California, Santa Barbara and drafted “El Plan de Santa Barbara,” which has now become important history and documented what has guided our organization to better serve our community. 
Through these documents, our organization is dedicated to the empowerment of raza students by working towards self-determination in our communities. Students develop a sense of identity, leadership and community. As an organization, we recognize our role as the official voice of all raza students on campus, and, taking this into account, our purpose is to advocate on behalf of raza students needs as well as offer our support. MEChA’s goal is to create a unity amongst students on campus and to make sure they are aware that they have a familia away from home without forgetting how community conditions have historically affected us. We aim to increase retention through our Calmecac mentoring program, increase educational access through Xinachtli, and raise consciousness of community issues with our Raza Youth Empowerment Program.","Political, Cultural",(323) 427-7926,mechadeucla@gmail.com,mechadeucla.com,Vivyana Prado,Eduardo Velasquez,Brian Luna,ORLANDO Luna

Our purpose here on Earth is to worship God and to make Christ’s love known. Our mission is to advance the gospel of Jesus and His Kingdom into all the nations, by establishing and equipping laborers and disciple-makers to be sent out to build up generations of disciples of Christ everywhere.

Our Vision 

Evangelize: God desires for all men to be saved. To make a disciple, one must find a willing person first, a process that often entails sharing the gospel to those who haven’t accepted it before. By sharing the good news of the Gospel to people everywhere, we open opportunities for them to know Jesus and receive his salvation. This vision of evangelism operates on all scales, from our families and friends to the nations.
Establish: God wants every believer to mature in their faith in Him. We hope to establish disciples of Christ by laying a foundation of devotion to Christ and building Christlike character. Devotion to Christ as expressed by an enjoyment of the Word of God, a zeal for prayer, and a love for the family of Christ are essentials to establish in a disciple’s life. These are necessary for transforming a disciple’s character to be more Christlike.
Equip: God commands us all to go and make disciples! We equip brothers and sisters to make new disciples themselves by teaching them how to share the Gospel and how to establish and encourage others in the faith. By training committed disciples and challenging their faith, we hope to develop them into disciplemakers, and perhaps even makers of disciplemakers.","Religious - Christian, Leadership",408-219-4950,icabruins@gmail.com,http://www.tinyurl.com/bruinica,Adele Zhang,Jordan Ong,Claire Su,ASHLEY Pham

Our purpose here on Earth is to worship God and to make Christ’s love known. Our mission is to advance the gospel of Jesus and His Kingdom into all the nations, by establishing and equipping laborers and disciple-makers to be sent out to build up generations of disciples of Christ everywhere.

Our Vision 

Evangelize: God desires for all men to be saved. To make a disciple, one must find a willing person first, a process that often entails sharing the gospel to those who haven’t accepted it before. By sharing the good news of the Gospel to people everywhere, we open opportunities for them to know Jesus and receive his salvation. This vision of evangelism operates on all scales, from our families and friends to the nations.
Establish: God wants every believer to mature in their faith in Him. We hope to establish disciples of Christ by laying a foundation of devotion to Christ and building Christlike character. Devotion to Christ as expressed by an enjoyment of the Word of God, a zeal for prayer, and a love for the family of Christ are essentials to establish in a disciple’s life. These are necessary for transforming a disciple’s character to be more Christlike.
Equip: God commands us all to go and make disciples! We equip brothers and sisters to make new disciples themselves by teaching them how to share the Gospel and how to establish and encourage others in the faith. By training committed disciples and challenging their faith, we hope to develop them into disciplemakers, and perhaps even makers of disciplemakers.","Religious - Christian, Leadership",408-219-4950,icabruins@gmail.com,http://www.tinyurl.com/bruinica,Adele Zhang,Jordan Ong,Claire Su,ASHLEY Pham

Students will be mentored by graduate students from UCLA’s Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology through all stages of an independent scientific project; from development of methods, to data collection on the UC James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve one of the 39 field sites apart of the University of California Natural Reserve System, to the write up of a scientific poster. Further, it is our goal to foster meaningful relationships between the student interns and the graduate student mentors that will last beyond just completion of their project. This will be accomplished through weekly and monthly meetings and community oriented social events. Lastly, during the duration of the program students will also be exposed to workshops and information sessions aimed at assisting in the transferring process and building tangible knowledge of scientific methods that can be applied in their future undergraduate research and graduate studies. Our program structure is as follows: (1) Community College students interested in the natural sciences and conducting scientific research in the field will be invited to apply to this program. The program will run from April to August, culminating in a 10 day trip to the field to collect data and the completion of a poster in time for the UCLA Summer Poster Symposium. (2) Students will be paired with UCLA graduate students in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department whose field research interests most closely align with their own. Students will meet virtually with their mentors weekly and in person monthly. Students and their mentors will develop an independent observational field project that could feasibly be completed with ten days of data collection during the summer. (3)By the beginning of July, students will have completed a literature review and a methods protocol for their proposed field project. In late July, students and graduate mentors will travel to the James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve. This reserve is located approximately 2 hours from UCLA in the San Bernardino National Forest and is a part of the University of California Natural Reserve System. Travel, food, and lodging will be included for all participants. (4) While in the field participants will be assisted by their graduate student mentors in collecting and analyzing data for their proposed project. Before returning home each student will have a completed scientific poster. (5) Aside from enacting their proposed research, students will attend skill-building workshops focused on cultivating tangible scientific and fieldwork skills that can be used throughout their careers. For example, interns will be introduced to ‘R’ Statistical software for data analysis and taught how to use species identification guides in the field.

forward with our careers, we also seek to understand how to be able to use our
skills to think creatively and critically so as to solve real-life problems.

The student organization aims to volunteer with a socially-oriented data science
program/organization. Some socially-oriented data science fellowships, typically in
conjunction with non-profits and local governments, are available. The group will
conduct voluntary analytical projects on the data from the public sector such as
road accidents, public hospitals, public policy efficiency and etc. The aim of these
projects will be to make an impact on the society with the help of data science.
This organization will solely focus on social good and offer various opportunities
for volunteering, whether it’s through mentoring or using data science skills to help
solve a social problem. The group will try to coordinate with many non-profits, host
competitions and hackathons along the same vein.

The organization will consider solutions to real-world problems that we encounter on a daily basis. While useful in framing and presenting problems, competitions aren’t completely necessary for problem solving. A resourceful data scientist can identify and work to solve social good problems on their own, with the data available to them.

This disease has devastating impacts on patients and their families, and thus, efforts should be taken to decrease its incidence among the population. A significant number of cancer cases can be prevented with a healthy lifestyle, as environmental factors play an influential role in mutating genes and activating cancerous cells. Considering the current concerns regarding this disease, our organization aims to increase awareness about different cancers and their prevention methods. By doing so, we hope to ultimately decrease the number of new cancer cases each year.
1- Since drug and alcohol abuse, and obesity are linked to cancer, CPP conducts information sessions, activities and events to promote a healthy lifestyle—both at UCLA and at local highschools.
2- As a prevention method for skin cancer, sun-safety sessions shall be conducted to emphasize the importance of sunscreen.
3- General meetings shall host panels with physicians to increase cancer awareness.
4- Cancer-related careers shall be discussed in general meetings, in multiple fields.
5- General meetings can host cancer researchers to inform club members about the recent advances in cancer treatment and prevention
6- Fundraiser events shall be organized to raise money for cancer research and treatment, collaborating with well-known charities.
7- Most importantly, CPP aims to increase awareness about Human 
Papillomavirus (HPV) not only in the UCLA community but also in the greater Los Angeles area. 
The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is currently a great concern of the medical society as it can develop into various health problems such as genital warts and different cancers. In fact, HPV is the leading cause of cervical cancer among the general population. Fortunately, there are methods to prevent HPV such as becoming vaccinated, being screened, and practicing safer sexual relationships. Despite being a vulnerable target for HPV—the most common sexually transmitted infection—a significant number of college students are unaware of this disease and its prevention methods. We hope that by explaining the complications associated with HPV we can increase the rate of vaccination in our community and thus, decrease the prevalence of cervical cancer.","Service - Community Involvement, Medical",310-488-8260,uclacpp@gmail.com,,Golbarg  Rahimi,Rana Yakhshi Tafti,Mahdi Rafati,ASHLEY Pham

This disease has devastating impacts on patients and their families, and thus, efforts should be taken to decrease its incidence among the population. A significant number of cancer cases can be prevented with a healthy lifestyle, as environmental factors play an influential role in mutating genes and activating cancerous cells. Considering the current concerns regarding this disease, our organization aims to increase awareness about different cancers and their prevention methods. By doing so, we hope to ultimately decrease the number of new cancer cases each year.
1- Since drug and alcohol abuse, and obesity are linked to cancer, CPP conducts information sessions, activities and events to promote a healthy lifestyle—both at UCLA and at local highschools.
2- As a prevention method for skin cancer, sun-safety sessions shall be conducted to emphasize the importance of sunscreen.
3- General meetings shall host panels with physicians to increase cancer awareness.
4- Cancer-related careers shall be discussed in general meetings, in multiple fields.
5- General meetings can host cancer researchers to inform club members about the recent advances in cancer treatment and prevention
6- Fundraiser events shall be organized to raise money for cancer research and treatment, collaborating with well-known charities.
7- Most importantly, CPP aims to increase awareness about Human 
Papillomavirus (HPV) not only in the UCLA community but also in the greater Los Angeles area. 
The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is currently a great concern of the medical society as it can develop into various health problems such as genital warts and different cancers. In fact, HPV is the leading cause of cervical cancer among the general population. Fortunately, there are methods to prevent HPV such as becoming vaccinated, being screened, and practicing safer sexual relationships. Despite being a vulnerable target for HPV—the most common sexually transmitted infection—a significant number of college students are unaware of this disease and its prevention methods. We hope that by explaining the complications associated with HPV we can increase the rate of vaccination in our community and thus, decrease the prevalence of cervical cancer.","Service - Community Involvement, Medical",310-488-8260,uclacpp@gmail.com,,Golbarg  Rahimi,Rana Yakhshi Tafti,Mahdi Rafati,ASHLEY Pham

Students serve as research associates and work alongside neurologists during code strokes. Responsibilities include collecting information relating to the patient’s medical history and neurological deficits in order to identify potential candidates for enrollment in clinical trials that aim to find novel treatments for stroke. Students also serve as speakers who reach out to various communities. To date, more than 120 students have participated in the program, delivering over 300 lectures to over 7000 individuals. Formal testing has demonstrated that these presentations are highly effective, resulting in a significant increase in post-education stroke awareness. Through integrating experiences from clinical exposure in the Ronald Reagan Emergency Department, neurological rounds, health fairs, and presentations, this sect of the Stroke Program strives to provide a force to minimize response time and to facilitate treatment.","Medical, Service - Outreach",(951) 567-3479,strokeforce@gmail.com,https://www.strokeprogram.org/,Nathan Sanchez,Ikaasa Suri,Jakob Morgenland,PAMELA Cysner

Further, it is our goal to foster meaningful relationships between the student interns and the graduate student mentors that will last beyond just completion of their project. This will be accomplished through weekly and monthly meetings and community oriented social events. Lastly, during the duration of the program students will also be exposed to workshops and information sessions aimed at assisting in the transferring process and building tangible knowledge of scientific methods that can be applied in their future undergraduate research and graduate studies. Our program structure is as follows: (1) Community College students interested in the natural sciences and conducting scientific research in the field will be invited to apply to this program. The program will run from April to August, culminating in a 10 day trip to the field to collect data and the completion of a poster in time for the UCLA Summer Poster Symposium. (2) Students will be paired with UCLA graduate students in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department whose field research interests most closely align with their own. Students will meet virtually with their mentors weekly and in person monthly. Students and their mentors will develop an independent observational field project that could feasibly be completed with ten days of data collection during the summer. (3)By the beginning of July, students will have completed a literature review and a methods protocol for their proposed field project. In late July, students and graduate mentors will travel to the James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve. This reserve is located approximately 2 hours from UCLA in the San Bernardino National Forest and is a part of the University of California Natural Reserve System. Travel, food, and lodging will be included for all participants. (4) While in the field participants will be assisted by their graduate student mentors in collecting and analyzing data for their proposed project. Before returning home each student will have a completed scientific poster. (5) Aside from enacting their proposed research, students will attend skill-building workshops focused on cultivating tangible scientific and fieldwork skills that can be used throughout their careers. For example, interns will be introduced to ‘R’ Statistical software for data analysis and taught how to use species identification guides in the field.

We assist students with the facilitation of resources, and advocate for our growing community which is fostered by non-traditional students, advocates and amazing faculty.
 
Our  Mission:
As the Non-Traditional Student Network is to function as both a social, academic, and instituational support system for the diverse and growing demographic of non-traditional students at UCLA.

What is a non-traditional student?
-Anyone returning to school after taking a break from their educational goals. 
-Working professionals finishing a degree or working on a new one. 
-Parents returning to school after starting a family.
-People returning from military service.
-Older students returning to school after taking time of to pursue other life goals
-Transfer students
-Part-time students
-Commuter students
-Married students
-Students who work full-time while enrolled and are financially independent 
-And more! 

The 'non-traditional student' experience, and identity, falls outside of a traditional high school-to-college path. Despite the size and prevalence of the non-traditional student community most college systems are geared toward the traditional student. One glaring example of this is that non-traditional students now constitute about 40% of college students nationally and about 30% of UCLA's population, yet, there is no system in place to ensure effective communication between the college and the large non-traditional student base, there is no official transfer center on the UCLA campus, no place for students in this position to gather or go for support and amenity. 

The Network at UCLA takes a more deliberate approach in bringing all students into the Bruin family, supporting and advocating specifically for those who took a 'non-traditional' path to get here.","Transfer Students, Social",(310)418-7114,UCLAnontrads@gmail.com,https://uclantsn.wixsite.com/ntsn,Abraham Flores,Abraham  Urias,Scarly  Guardado,KRISTOPHER Kaupalolo

We believe that all students deserve to enjoy long-term recovery from addiction while building meaningful lives of academic and social engagement.  

Our Primary Mission is to ensure that every UCLA student who has a desire to get and stay sober has a safe and supportive place to go on campus. No UCLA student should have to be isolated while seeking to get or stay free from addiction. B4R aims to generate and sustain sober fellowship and community through numerous means, including: providing resources about recovery assets on campus, organizing fun and sober activities, and being a source of sober support for recovering students and their allies, friends, and families. Addictions have serious consequences for UCLA students -- emotionally, socially, academically, and physically. We recognize there are many types of addictive behavior, and that most people are affected by addiction in some way. Therefore, students struggling with any range or variety of addictions and or compulsive behaviors (Ex. drugs, alcohol, sex, food, gambling, porn, self harm etc.)

In summary, we aim to provide a safe and supportive environment for UCLA students who:

1. Want to get and stay sober from alcohol, drugs or other addictive behaviors

2. Are allies, friends, and/or family members of individuals in recovery

The sorority supports and provides a safe space for people of all sexual orientations, gender identities, and diverse backgrounds. It emphasizes emotional support, personal development,
unconditional acceptance.

Founded in Spring of 2009, Gamma Rho Lambda has expanded into the first LGBT sorority on campus. In Spring 2010 GRL officially affiliated with UCLA's Multi-Interest Greek Council and became Zeta Chapter.

Some examples of Gamma Rho Lambda's events are: game night, home-cooked dinners, Women's Day, socials, sister dates, as well as an end of the year banquet. We've volunteered at AIDS Walk and Vote for Equality and marched at LA pride and Long Beach Pride. We've fundraised by selling bracelets, rainbow cupcakes, and other baked goods.

Gamma Rho Lambda is much smaller than most typical sororities, but we pride ourselves in this fact. Our intimate size allows us to get to know every member and grow together as a community. Our biggest priority is to create a second home for our members, so that every member feels they have a family at UCLA. We provide an opportunity for growth and diversity. In addition, Gamma Rho Lambda aims to provide a safe, accepting, and supportive space for queer members who may not be out to their families.

On a national level, Gamma Rho Lambda currently has 14 chapters across the country and 1 colony. Our chapters are at Arizona State University, San Diego State University, CSU Northridge, UCLA, Purdue, SUNY- Albany, Northern Arizona University, University of Houston, UC Berkley, and UC Riverside, Ball State,Tulane, Iowa State, and American University. We also have a colony at University of Iowa. Each year we have a summer convention where representatives from all the chapters and colonies come and meet their fellow siblings. This weekend is not only a bonding experience, but an experience to share what every chapter has accomplished while spreading both ideas and concerns to each other and our National Council.

Since 2002, PAC has planned and executed an annual 26-Hour Dance Marathon. DM seeks to empower the UCLA campus community in the fight against pediatric AIDS, raising funds and awareness about the importance of HIV education and testing, while helping young people make a difference in halting the spread of this devastating pandemic. 

Now entering its 18th year, DM has grown to be the largest student-run philanthropic event that raises funds and awareness for HIV/AIDS. However, DM is only a part of our larger, umbrella organization: the Pediatric AIDS Coalition (PAC). Now, not only will the students involved with PAC put on and participate in DM, but they will also participate in other events in an attempt to involve more of the community; people that may be inclined to fight for the cause but may not necessarily be interested in a DM.

Dance Marathon has raised over $5.5 million in the past 16 years, benefiting HIV-positive children around the world. Proceeds benefit the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, “the largest Pediatric AIDS foundation in the United States“, the Laurel Foundation which is a free summer camp program that provide HIV-affected children with the experience of a lifetime, and the UCLA AIDS Institute, a cutting-edge research facility at the forefront of the search for a cure. Dance Marathon 2019 will be in the historic PAULEY PAVILION in April 2019!

PAC also sponsors activities on campus throughout the year for the UCLA community including AIDS education in the form of performances and presentations, mentor days with kids from the camps, free HIV testing, and coordination of major events for World AIDS Day at UCLA. New programs include the Life Skills Retreat and a Family Mentorship Program. PAC is constantly looking for new, innovative ways to unite students, community activists, celebrities and leaders around the cause of pediatric AIDS treatment and eradication, and PAC is looking forward to its expansion into the greater Los Angeles community.

DM has become a poster in the UCLA community, so much so that people commonly say that you can't graduate UCLA without having done DM at least once. People say that our generation is not empathetic, but DM proves them wrong. We unite 140 people as a committee and 3000+ in the community to join together to fight this cause.","Social Activism, Educational",(702) 403-0472,pac.president.ucla@gmail.com,https://pediatricaidscoalition.org/,Nina Enholm,Eleni Rally,Sophie  Ahmad,PAMELA Cysner

Specifically, our team of UCLA students designs, manufactures, and tests custom drones for accomplishing a series of mission objectives, as outlined by the AUVSI SUAS competition rules for the current season. This competition is held annually at the end of the school year in Maryland, where over 60 teams (half of which are international) compete for the best mission performance, technical design paper, and flight readiness presentation.
UAS@UCLA complements the undergraduate engineering education at UCLA by offering the chance to gain hands-on experience on a complex engineering project. This project requires members to not only think outside the box of their major, but also learn collaboration and management skills through experience. Ultimately, UAS@UCLA is a big commitment, but the skills that are taught on the team directly apply to the professional environments you will experience in later jobs and internships.
As of 2018, UAS@UCLA has competed twice in the AUVSI competition, producing the two drones seen in the videos above. Our most recent drone, Spinny, is a 5ft diameter industrial-grade drone capable of 100lbs maximum lift and close to an hour of flight time at its base configuration. The current plan for this upcoming season is to use the existing flight vehicle hardware to mature the software framework running on board and on the ground to maximize mission performance and reliability of the platform. In addition, our team will begin the design process for our next drone -- a plane designed to build upon the legacy of Spinny and provide a new set of challenges for our team to address. Although the plane may turn into a two-year development, there will be lots of engineering questions to be answered by new members to ensure the success of this platform.
Finally, UAS@UCLA is a family, and the connections you make on the team can not only serve to further your professional career, but also give you support during and beyond your time in the undergraduate programs offered at UCLA. One of the main goals of our 2018 - 2019 leadership team is to grow our club's culture and attract not only the best engineers to join our program, but also develop a diversified team with extensive collaboration opportunities among other teams at UCLA and internal career resources for leading members into their dream internship/job position in the STEM fields.","Engineering, Technology",(760)681-6528,unmannedsystems.ucla@gmail.com,uasatucla.org,David Thorne,Comran Morshed,Armaan Singh,ORLANDO Luna

Without homes or any mode of transportation, hundreds of homeless people walk an average of 13 miles a day.

Many even refuse to air out their feet, conducive of many foot problems, afraid that their shoes might get stolen. As we, Happy Feet Clinic, provide those basic necessities and more, we are blessed with a powerfully humbling experience.

At shelters around Los Angeles, including the Union Rescue Mission in downtown L.A., the Ocean Park Community Center in Santa Monica, the New Image Emergency Shelter in South LA, and PATH in Westwood, we treat hundreds of homeless people to a soothing foot wash in a tub of warm, soapy water. Next, we work side by side with podiatrists as they administer foot exams for the homeless community. Throughout the process, we interact with a variety of people in need of help and most importantly become aware of the large prominence of under-served communities and their critical need for assistance.

For many students, it is hard to grasp how prominent this population is in a thriving country as America. At first, students squirm at the thought of washing feet (especially those that may need much more care than our own). As soon as the event comes to an end however, many are instilled with the feeling to return again and again.

The LEAD program will target primarily African American 9th and 10th grade students who did not pass algebra in middle school or their previous year in high school. The students will take a diagnostic at the beginning and end of the year to monitor growth in specific concepts for each student and the group as a whole. Based upon these tests the curriculum for the program will be organized around the concepts of greatest struggle as highlighted by the diagnostic. 
The first approach that LEAD will take will attempt to counter the present learning style in a typical math classroom, as it will encourage asking questions, working in groups, and a growth mindset. The program will attempt to execute the following three elements: basic skills, conceptual understanding and problem solving. LEAD will use real life application relevant to the students and by motivating students to work together and to think out loud, we hope to build leadership skills and development.
The second approach includes having activities and discussions that allow students to examine the intersections of race, class and math to get a greater understanding of the disparity of African American students in high level math classes and to combat the stigma of inadequacy.","Educational, Community Service",(424) 313-4860,lead@ucla.edu,https://leaducla.weebly.com/,Kailash Ram,Smriti Sanchita,Eshan Uniyal,ASHLEY Pham

Because of the drop in African-American students at UCLA School of Law after the passage of proposition 209, the journal was sent to Columbia where publication could be continued.
One of the Journals founding editors noted that it was important that there be a forum for providing a theoretical framework for practical daily application of Black legal ideas and concepts. The Journal has aimed to build on this tradition by publishing articles that make a substantive contribution to current dialogue taking place around issues such as affirmative action, employment law, the criminal justice system, community development and labor issues. The Journal has a commitment to publish articles that inspire new thought, explore new alternatives and contribute to current jurisprudential stances.
In 2005, a group of students at UCLA began the process of bringing the journal back to its birthplace through the organization of a symposium entitled ""Regression Analysis: The Status of African Americans in American Legal Education.""

UGSP is designed to provide valuable social support to these students whom may otherwise find it difficult to pursue their graduate studies. Through activities, mentorship, and community outreach, we hope to provide a community that encourages the potential and promise of those from underrepresented groups.  By promoting and improving multicultural training in psychology, we hope to not only increase ethnic minority student recruitment, retention, and graduation but also improve intergroup relations within our department. UGSP operates with the following branches:

UGSP Brown Bag Committee
This committee organizes a lecture series that is open to all graduate students. These talks are given by faculty members and post-doctoral students from underrepresented backgrounds or whose research focuses on diversity issues. Each Brown Bag lecture includes both a research presentation and a career development component. This speaker series allows graduate students to network with prominent faculty members from underrepresented groups, hopefully fostering a sense social connectedness and community within the Psychology Department.

UGSP Undergraduate Outreach Committee 
This committee organizes panels for undergraduate students to learn about various aspects of the graduate student experience. We hope to galvanize interest in graduate school by offering examples of successful underrepresented students from their own university. We also hope that this will provide undergraduates with the opportunity to connect with graduate students so they feel comfortable asking questions about diversity in graduate school.

UGSP High School Outreach Committee 
As members of underrepresented groups, we find it imperative to give back to our communities through teaching, education, and service.  UGSP will target high schools in low-income neighborhoods and will hold lectures for both parents and students about getting into college.

UGSP Social Committee 
The Social Committee plans and coordinates various events each year, typically off campus. Our goal in organizing these events is to foster a sense of community among UGSP members. It is a chance for students to interact with people that come from diverse backgrounds who share similar experiences.","Academic, Cultural/Ethnic",(516)998-8215,ucla.ugsp@gmail.com,https://ugsp.psych.ucla.edu/,ReJoyce Green,Gerald Higginbotham,Blanche Wright,MICHAEL Gamez

The media has given us a specific image of what is beautiful, and we want to encourage every student on campus to feel confident and beautiful no matter how their body looks. By improving our self esteem, we can focus less time on our physical appearance and more time on living our lives. We hope to enhance the self esteem of students by demonstrating beauty isn’t only skin-deep, and by pushing students to be positive with themselves and not to be so critical. We also want to show how physical health affects mental health. We want to teach students ways to take care of their own health which will help them feel better. For instance we emphasize healthy eating and fitness, but encourage individuals to focus on feeling good rather than looking good. We want to make help accessible to those who are struggling with body dismorphia or eating disorders. Through our programming, we hope to educate the student body on these issues and how to tackle them. The Body Image Task Force also aims to help students learn how to handle college stress. We hope to provide stress outlets because we believe that mental health is also connected to self esteem and in general happiness.

Our club’s main mission is to work on reducing the current widespread epidemic of chronic diseases, such as obesity and cardiovascular disease, through prevention and educational programs. These two main programs are: 1) FitlifeFlow program and 2) Health Project. The FitlifeFlow program recruits undergraduate students to pledge to participate in a 5-week exercise program, exercising three days a week for thirty minutes each time. A few scientific research studies have been published describing the outcomes of these incentivized exercise programs, showing that there is a long-term success rate of increasing one’s overall commitment to routine exercise. The Health Project, the other program, will be an education-focused program, as we will travel to local schools and educate young students on the long-term health benefits of exercise and nutrition. We will aim to make these educational presentations fun and engaging, so that the kids are able to absorb some important facts in regards to health and nutrition. 

The Health Guardians of America club will aim to educate the public, and especially at-risk youth, about the nationwide obesity epidemic that leads to chronic heart disease, diabetes, and other preventable diseases.

We assist students with the facilitation of resources, and advocate for our growing community which is fostered by non-traditional students, advocates and amazing faculty.
 
Our  Mission:
As the Non-Traditional Student Network is to function as both a social, academic, and instituational support system for the diverse and growing demographic of non-traditional students at UCLA.

What is a non-traditional student?
-Anyone returning to school after taking a break from their educational goals. 
-Working professionals finishing a degree or working on a new one. 
-Parents returning to school after starting a family.
-People returning from military service.
-Older students returning to school after taking time of to pursue other life goals
-Transfer students
-Part-time students
-Commuter students
-Married students
-Students who work full-time while enrolled and are financially independent 
-And more! 

The 'non-traditional student' experience, and identity, falls outside of a traditional high school-to-college path. Despite the size and prevalence of the non-traditional student community most college systems are geared toward the traditional student. One glaring example of this is that non-traditional students now constitute about 40% of college students nationally and about 30% of UCLA's population, yet, there is no system in place to ensure effective communication between the college and the large non-traditional student base, there is no official transfer center on the UCLA campus, no place for students in this position to gather or go for support and amenity. 

The Network at UCLA takes a more deliberate approach in bringing all students into the Bruin family, supporting and advocating specifically for those who took a 'non-traditional' path to get here.","Transfer Students, Social",(310)418-7114,UCLAnontrads@gmail.com,https://uclantsn.wixsite.com/ntsn,Abraham Flores,Abraham  Urias,Scarly  Guardado,KRISTOPHER Kaupalolo

That in and of itself is a fantastic accomplishment. But, now what? UCLA has many business clubs and has a few transfer clubs, but not a business club that is dedicated to helping transfer students. We have a unique set of challenges that traditional 4-year students simply do not have to deal with. Every student has to balance adjusting to the rigors of UCLA academics, finding a place to belong in a sea of 30,000 Bruins, and searching for a suitable job for after graduation. None, however, have to accomplish all of this in 2 years! Furthermore, we believe the relative lack of visibility of transfers has discouraged many from participating fully in campus life. Therefore, we've created this network for transfers who are interested in pursuing careers in business to bridge the gap between academic life at UCLA and the professional world outside of campus. We will help develop your network of UCLA peers, UCLA staff, and working professionals in order to get your foot in the working world.

Since its opening, UMMA Clinic has served over 30,000 patients, 90% of whom are below the poverty line. UVP has been assisting UMMA Clinic since it's inception and played a crucial role in the clinic's early success by providing a steady group of volunteers to assist at the clinic. UVP allows students the opportunity to volunteer at health fairs, giving them first-hand exposure to the health care field in one of the most underserved regions in the nation. Volunteers also help at the many events in which UMMA Clinic participates, including the Hawthorne Health Fair, Tax Day, Fremont Farmers Market, and Humanitarian Day. 

To further address the needs of the community, UVP is committed to providing preventative health education to students and patients in South Los Angeles.

UVP has established a weekly, after-school health and physical education course at both 68th Street Elementary School and ISLAH LA Academy with the aim of promoting healthy living. As part of this course, students are taught lessons on nutrition and the importance of healthy eating, as well as other health topics. Following each lesson plan are fun and interactive outdoor activities to get the students moving, with the ultimate goal of inspiring a lifelong enjoyment of physical activity.

In addition to the youth, UVP also aims to educate the adult population of South Los Angeles about various health disorders through the Preventative Health Initiative (PHI). Every week, UVP volunteers spread awareness of initial warning signs, disease prevention, and healthy life-style practices to the UMMA Clinic patients and local community members.

Volunteers work with health professionals, build leadership in health-related community service, interact with patients, become educated on predominant community health issues, and have workshops to help make them strong leaders in the health field and community.

By improving our self esteem, we can focus less time on our physical appearance and more time on living our lives. We hope to enhance the self esteem of students by demonstrating beauty isn’t only skin-deep, and by pushing students to be positive with themselves and not to be so critical. We also want to show how physical health affects mental health. We want to teach students ways to take care of their own health which will help them feel better. For instance we emphasize healthy eating and fitness, but encourage individuals to focus on feeling good rather than looking good. We want to make help accessible to those who are struggling with body dismorphia or eating disorders. Through our programming, we hope to educate the student body on these issues and how to tackle them. The Body Image Task Force also aims to help students learn how to handle college stress.

Often times, these individuals lack access to basic social and health services. Our organization is partnered with the Mobile Clinic Project at UCLA, a student-run free clinic that provides homeless individuals with basic medical and social services. Oftentimes, Mobile Clinic clients with chronic illnesses need follow-up care. However, it was observed that numerous clients were not able to access adequate follow-up care due to reasons such as lack of transportation, difficulty navigating the healthcare system, and/or other social barriers. Companion Care was created to help clients overcome these barriers. Our organization sets up appointments with physicians at a community health center and provides volunteers to accompany clients to their appointments. The Companion Care volunteers are there as means of support through the process. Companions are there every step of the way, standing in solidarity to assist clients in overcoming the barriers to healthcare access that homeless individuals experience.

The study will focus on participants experience with medical emergencies, their level of preparedness, and their willingness to help.

Lastly, we want to work on creating first aid kits tailored to the homeless and underserved communities. These will be handed out to all participants who complete our program.

Through Building Heroes, club members will gain a deeper understanding of first aid techniques, and learn how to lead hands on discussions and lectures.

Our club’s main mission is to work on reducing the current widespread epidemic of chronic diseases, such as obesity and cardiovascular disease, through prevention and educational programs. These two main programs are: 1) FitlifeFlow program and 2) Health Project. The FitlifeFlow program recruits undergraduate students to pledge to participate in a 5-week exercise program, exercising three days a week for thirty minutes each time. A few scientific research studies have been published describing the outcomes of these incentivized exercise programs, showing that there is a long-term success rate of increasing one’s overall commitment to routine exercise. The Health Project, the other program, will be an education-focused program, as we will travel to local schools and educate young students on the long-term health benefits of exercise and nutrition. We will aim to make these educational presentations fun and engaging, so that the kids are able to absorb some important facts in regards to health and nutrition. 

The Health Guardians of America club will aim to educate the public, and especially at-risk youth, about the nationwide obesity epidemic that leads to chronic heart disease, diabetes, and other preventable diseases.

With our organization our first goal will be to volunteer with existing organizations that already focus on healthcare and homelessness. Our definition of healthcare is broad, it doesn’t end with physical healthcare. We will also focus on other aspects of healthcare such as hygiene and mental health. We are going to connect with organizations including but not limited to PATH, Venice Family Clinic, Midnight Mission and others and send our members there to volunteer with them. These organizations help homeless individuals with healthcare, and we will learn more about this divide between homelessness and healthcare together as a club. Our second goal will be to fundraise throughout the year towards a cause of the members choosing. It will be a goal that may help one of the organizations that we work with or a specific cause that connects homelessness and healthcare. This fundraising will occur throughout the quarters, and at the end of the year we will donate the money together as a club to the cause that we have been fundraising for all year.  Our overarching goal as an organization is to inform individuals about the divide between homelessness and healthcare. We will hold events to inform our members first and then the broader UCLA community. We will hold outreach events and information sessions for anyone part of the UCLA community. We hope that this education and outreach will help us create a ripple of change.

As of now, I will be partnering with small businesses and accepting donations in order to be able to put together care packages for the elderly. Each box will contain high demand items such as toilet paper rolls, hand sanitizers, face masks, gloves, disinfectant wipes and sprays as well as non-perishable food such as pasta, rice, lentils, canned goods etc... 
Additionally, my organization will do everything it can to support our healthcare system during these very difficult times. We will be reaching out to every private clinic (plastic surgeons, dermatologists etc...) and small manufactures to see whether we can help them donate their PPE to hospitals in the Los Angeles area (poor neighborhoods) that are in need of them. 
We already donated $3,420 worth of hand sanitizer to the mlk hospital in Compton and intend on donating a lot more to many other hospitals that are in need. 
In regards to the underprivileged division, we will be using the same concept of care packages and ship them to refugee camps across California. 
Finally, I’d love to be able to join hands with big corporate companies such as Target, Ralph’s, Trader Joe’s, UPS and many more so that we can come together as one in order to support the elderly, the disadvantaged and the healthcare system. 
I already got a lot of people on board and we are all extremely determined to help our community the best way we can during these extremely difficult times.
